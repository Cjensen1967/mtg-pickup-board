# Netlify Deployment Steps for MTG Pickup Board

Your project is now ready for deployment! Follow these steps to get it live on Netlify.

## âœ… What's Already Done

- âœ… Code modified to use environment variables in production
- âœ… Netlify configuration file (`netlify.toml`) created
- âœ… Build script (`build-env.js`) created for environment injection

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and click "New repository"
   - Name it something like `mtg-pickup-board` or `cardconnect-nw`
   - Make it **public** (required for free Netlify)
   - **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Connect your local repo to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy on Netlify

2. **Click "New site from Git"**

3. **Connect to GitHub and select your repository**

4. **Configure build settings:**

   - Click "Deploy site"

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
