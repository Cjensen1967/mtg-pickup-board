# Project Goals & Vision

## Mission Statement

To create a simple, professional, and trustworthy community board for Magic: The Gathering players in the Pacific Northwest. The platform will facilitate local pickup games and card trades, strengthening the community through word-of-mouth sharing.

## Guiding Principles

1.  **Simple but Professional:** The application must be clean, reliable, and inspire trust. The user experience should be straightforward and intuitive.
2.  **Community-Focused:** Every feature should be designed to connect local players. The project's success will be measured by its value to the Pacific NW MTG community.
3.  **No Over-Engineering:** We will intentionally avoid complexity. Features will be limited to the essentials to maintain a lean, focused, and low-maintenance application.
4.  **Mobile-First:** The design must be responsive and fully functional on mobile devices, as players will often access it on the go.
5.  **Anonymous & Safe:** To encourage participation, no user accounts are required. However, we will implement basic security measures to prevent spam and abuse.

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful if:

*   Players can consistently and easily post and find local games.
*   The trading board facilitates regular, successful connections between local traders.
*   The site is perceived as a professional and trustworthy resource within the community.
*   The application requires minimal ongoing maintenance.
*   Adoption grows organically through word-of-mouth recommendations.

## Boundaries (What We Won't Build)

To prevent feature creep and maintain simplicity, we will explicitly avoid:

*   User accounts, profiles, or complex authentication systems.
*   Direct messaging, notifications, or integrated chat features.
*   A complex moderation system with user roles and permissions.
*   Integration with third-party card databases or price-checking APIs.
*   A rating, feedback, or reputation system.
