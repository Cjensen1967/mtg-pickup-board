## Project Status: âœ… COMPLETED & FULLY FUNCTIONAL

This project has been successfully implemented and is ready for deployment. All core features are working, including real-time updates, form validation, and database integration.

## Project Mission

To provide a trustworthy, no-frills platform that strengthens the local MTG community by connecting players for games and trades through word-of-mouth sharing.

## Features

*   **âœ… Game Finder:** Post and view pickup game requests with location, format, and time.
*   **âœ… Trade Board:** Post and view trade/buy/sell listings for cards and accessories.
*   **âœ… Real-Time Feed:** See new posts instantly without refreshing.
*   **âœ… Anonymous & Simple:** No accounts or logins required.
*   **âœ… Mobile-First:** Designed for use on the go.
*   **âœ… Professional UI:** Clean, responsive design with loading states and error handling.
*   **âœ… Auto-Cleanup:** Posts automatically deleted after 7 days to keep content fresh.

## Guiding Principles

*   **Simple but Professional:** Clean, reliable, and trustworthy.
*   **Community-Focused:** Built for local connections.
*   **No Over-Engineering:** Essential features only.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
*   **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL Database, Real-time Subscriptions)

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mtg-pickup-board.git
    ```
2.  **Create a Supabase project:**
    *   Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
    *   In your Supabase project, go to the **SQL Editor** and run the entire SQL query in `setup.sql`. This will create the necessary tables, enable Row Level Security, and create the function for cleaning up old posts.
3.  **Configure Supabase credentials:**
    *   Create a new file named `config.js` in the root of the project.
    *   In your Supabase project, go to **Settings** -> **API**.
    *   Copy the **Project URL** and **anon key** into your `config.js` file, like this:
        ```javascript
        // config.js
        const supabaseUrl = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL';
        const supabaseKey = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY';
        export { supabaseUrl, supabaseKey };
        ```
    *   The `config.js` file is included in the `.gitignore` to prevent you from accidentally committing your credentials.
4.  **Set up Automated Post Deletion:**
    *   In your Supabase project, go to **Database** -> **Cron Jobs**.
    *   Create a new cron job.
    *   Set the schedule (e.g., once a day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`).
    *   In the "Function to run" dropdown, select `delete_old_posts`.
5.  **Run the application locally:**
    *   This project uses ES6 modules, so you'll need to run it on a local server to avoid CORS issues.
    *   If you have Python installed, you can run the following command in the project directory:
        ```bash
        python -m http.server
        ```
    *   Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.
